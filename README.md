## ðŸ§  Problem Statement

In regions where access to healthcare professionals may be limited, many individuals struggle with diagnosing symptoms or understanding their potential health conditions. This project provides an **AI-powered personal health assistant** that helps users:

- Select their symptoms from a structured list
- Receive AI-generated diagnosis insights
- Track health conditions over time
- Prompt further action like visiting nearby healthcare facilities

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Used

**Name:** `Training.csv`  
**Source:** [Kaggle Disease Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset)  
**Description:** The dataset contains 4924 rows with 131 symptoms (as binary columns) and a `prognosis` label indicating the diagnosed condition.

## ðŸ§ª Google Colab Development Process

1. **Dataset Loading:**
   - Imported using `pandas` into a DataFrame.
   - Target column: `prognosis`.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Binary encoding of symptom presence.
   - Label encoding of disease names using `LabelEncoder`.
   - Removal of classes with fewer than 2 samples (for `stratify` compatibility).

3. **Model Training:**
   - Model used: `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn`.
   - 80/20 train/test split using `train_test_split`.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix.
   - Accuracy achieved: ~98% (depending on preprocessing).

5. **Model Saving:**
   ```python
   joblib.dump(clf, 'disease_model.pkl')
   joblib.dump(le, 'label_encoder.pkl')
   joblib.dump(symptom_list, 'symptom_list.pkl')
